Hi! I’m **Xueran Tao**, a second year Master’s student in Statistics at the **University of Chicago**.  
My research lies at the intersection of **statistical inference**, **machine learning**, and **representation learning**.  
I’m particularly interested in developing reliable and interpretable methods for modern data analysis—  
including **Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI++)**, **high-dimensional statistics**, and **Sparse Autoencoders for language and audio models**.  

Beyond research, I enjoy connecting ideas across disciplines—from theory to real-world applications in AI and generative modeling.  
Feel free to explore my publications, projects, and ongoing work below.
