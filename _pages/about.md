Welcome! I am a second year master student in [Statistics Department at the University of Chicago](https://stat.uchicago.edu/) where I am fortune to work with Prof. [Claire Donnat](https://donnate.github.io/). Prior to joining Uchicago, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Statistics and minor in Data Science and Big Data Technology from [Beijing Normal University](https://stat.bnu.edu.cn/)(BNU), where I worked with Prof. [Gaorong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cakQLOsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). You can find my CV [here](files/Xueran_Tao_CV.pdf).

My research lies at the intersection of statistical inference, machine learning, and representation learning. I’m particularly interested in developing reliable and interpretable methods for modern data analysis— including Prediction-Powered Inference, high-dimensional statistics, and Sparse Autoencoders for language and audio models.  


Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about choral singing. I was fortunate to study under Mr. Dapeng Meng, and served as a core member of the Children’s Choir of China National Radio (CNR)—now known as [Deep Space Choir](https://www.youtube.com/@deepspacechoir/featured)— for 12 years. During that time, I participated in numerous performances, national exchange tours, and professional recordings.
